## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Screen-Locker does not start:** Make sure you have saved the `.exe` file to your computer. Double-check that you have permission to run programs from unknown developers.

- **Shortcuts still work:** Screen-Locker needs administrator rights to block some system shortcuts. Try running the program as an administrator by right-clicking the `.exe` file and selecting "Run as administrator."

- **Can’t unlock the screen:** Use the Escape key or follow the on-screen instructions. If you set a password, enter it carefully.

- **Task Manager is still accessible:** Running as administrator helps prevent Task Manager access.

- **Program crashes or closes:** Ensure your Windows is up to date. Try downloading the latest version from the release page again.

## 🔒 Why Use Screen-Locker?

If you often step away from your computer, you want to keep your work and data safe. Screen-Locker helps by locking the screen without the need for heavy or complicated software. It protects your machine from tampering during short breaks.

Because it blocks common shortcut keys and disables Task Manager, someone cannot easily force quit the lock or access private information. It is a simple, silent guard for your computer.

---

## 📂 Portable and Open Source

Screen-Locker is portable. You don’t install it on your PC. Just run it from any folder or USB stick. This makes it easy to use anywhere without leaving traces on the computer.

Being open source means anyone can review the code. This builds trust since the app’s security measures are public and transparent.

---

## 🧰 Advanced Tips (Optional)

- You can use Screen-Locker with other security tools to increase your computer’s protection.
- Run it before leaving your workspace to ensure no one can access your desktop.
- Consider setting a strong password if the version you use supports it.
- Keep the `.exe` file in a safe location for easy access when needed.
